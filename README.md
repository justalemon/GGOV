GGO V (previously GGOHud) is a mod for Grand Theft Auto V that adds a couple of features from the Gun Gale Online VRMMO in Sword Art Online:

* Squad Members HUD
* Player Information HUD
* Inventory powered by PlayerCompanion

## Download

* [GitHub](https://github.com/justalemon/GGOV/releases)
* [5mods](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/ggo)
* [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/justalemon/ggov) (experimental)

## Installation

*Please note that you need to install [LemonUI](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/lemonui) and [PlayerCompanion](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/playercompanion) for GGOV to work.*

First, drag and drop all of the files inside of the 7zip into your **scripts** directory. Then, open the MANUAL INSTALL directory and copy those ytd files to **mods\update\update.rpf\x64\textures\script_txds.rpf**.

## Usage

After installing the mod, you will see the Squad Members and Player Information HUD elements. You can open the inventory by pressing Tab/R1/RB/R.

There is a menu that you can use to configure some options. This menu can be opened by entering **ggo** in the cheat input field.
